# Project GPU
This project demonstrates the application of image processing filters using both CPU and GPU implementations. The filters applied include a box filter and a Laplacian filter.
repository : https://github.com/wardiaMimi/gpu_project

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ``` cd projet_gpu```
3. Compile the code using the provided Makefile:
    ```make```
4. After running the `make` command, you will find the output images in the `projet_gpu` folder.

## Output
- `output_boxfilter_gpu.png`: Result of the box filter applied using GPU 
- `output_boxfilter_cpu.png`: Result of the box filter applied using GPU 
- `output_laplacian_cpu.png`: Result of the Laplacian filter applied using CPU
- `output_laplacian_gpu.png`: Result of the Laplacian filter applied using GPU
- `output.txt`: Text file containing the results of all files (laplacian.cu, laplacian.c, boxfilter.cu, boxfilter.c), including the time taken for each program.
